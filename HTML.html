<p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It allows the user to create and structure sections, paragraphs, headings, links, and blockquotes for web pages and 
applications. HTML is not a programming language, meaning it doesn’t have the ability to create dynamic functionality. Instead, it makes it possible to organize and 
format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.</p>

<p>HTML documents are files that end with a .html or .htm extension. You can view then using any web browser (such as Google Chrome, Safari, or Mozilla Firefox). 
The browser reads the HTML file and renders its content so that internet users can view it.</p>

<p>HTML is the main markup language of the web. It runs natively in every browser and is maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium.You can use it to create the 
content structure of websites and web applications. It’s the lowest level of frontend technologies, that serves as the basis for styling you can add with CSS and 
functionality you can implement using JavaScript.</p>
